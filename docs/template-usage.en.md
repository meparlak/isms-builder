## What is a Template?

A template is a versioned, status-managed document — for example a policy, a procedure,
or a release document. Each template follows a defined lifecycle and can be linked to
controls (SoA), risks, and other templates.

Available template types:

| Type | Purpose | Separate docs |
|---|---|---|
| **policy** | Binding rules (What applies?) | [template-type-policy.md](template-type-policy.md) |
| **procedure** | Work instructions (How is it done?) | [template-type-procedure.md](template-type-procedure.md) |
| **soa** | Supporting documents for the SoA process | [template-type-soa.md](template-type-soa.md) |
| **incident** | Incident response plans and templates | [template-type-incident.md](template-type-incident.md) |
| **release** | Change and release documentation | [template-type-release.md](template-type-release.md) |

---

## Roles and Permissions

| Action | Minimum role |
|---|---|
| Read templates | `reader` |
| Edit template (content, status) | `editor` |
| Create, move, delete templates | `contentowner` |
| Permanently delete, restore templates | `admin` |

## Creating a Template

**Step 1 — Choose type**
In the sidebar under the desired template type (e.g. "Policy") click **"+ New"** or
use the "Create" button at the top of the sidebar and select the type.

**Step 2 — Fill in required fields**
- **Title** — unique name (e.g. "Password Policy v1.0")
- **Owner** — responsible person or role
- **Valid from / Next review** — date fields for lifecycle management
- **Linked ISO controls** — optional link to SoA controls

**Step 3 — Enter content**
The content area supports **Markdown**. Headings, lists, tables and code blocks are
rendered. For structured policies the following outline is recommended:

```
# Title
## 1. Purpose
## 2. Scope
## 3. Rules
## 4. Responsibilities
## 5. Violations and consequences
## 6. Review and updates
```

**Step 4 — Save**
The template is saved with status `draft` and is visible only to logged-in users
with `reader` role or above.

## Lifecycle (Status Workflow)

Each template passes through four status stages:

```
draft  →  review  →  approved  →  archived
```

| Status | Meaning | Visible to |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | In progress, not yet released | From `reader` (internal) |
| `review` | Under review, awaiting approval | From `reader` (internal) |
| `approved` | Officially valid, in production use | From `reader` |
| `archived` | Superseded, kept for reference only | From `reader` |

**Changing status:** Use the status dropdown in the template detail view. Every
status change is logged with timestamp and user in the **status history**
(accessible via the clock icon in the template).

> **Audit note:** The complete status history is stored in the audit log and can be
> reviewed by the auditor. A template moved directly from `draft` to `approved`
> without `review` is permitted but should be a conscious organisational decision.

---

## Version History

Every saved change to the content is automatically stored as a version.
The version history is accessible via the **history icon** in the template and shows:

- Timestamp of the change
- User who made the change
- Previous content (diff available)

This enables the full traceability that ISO 27001 requires for documents.

---

## Attachments

Templates can have files attached (PDF, DOCX — max. 25 MB):

**Add attachment:** Click **"Upload attachment"** in the template detail view.
Minimum role: `editor`.

**Download attachment:** Visible to all users from `reader` upwards.

**Delete attachment:** Minimum role: `editor`.

---

## Links to Other Modules

Templates can be linked to other modules:

**→ SoA controls:** Select the ISO controls covered by this document. The control
will then appear in the SoA with a reference to the template ("implementation evidence").
This is relevant for the gap analysis and the compliance report.

**→ Risks:** Via the risk module, policies and procedures can be assigned to a risk
as risk-mitigating measures.

**→ Policy acknowledgement:** Approved policies can be sent to staff for confirmation
(module "Policy Acknowledgements").

---

## Moving a Template

A template can be moved to a different type (e.g. from `procedure` to `policy`) —
minimum role: `contentowner`. All links and the version history are preserved.

---

## Deleting and Restoring Templates

**Soft delete** (minimum role `contentowner`): The template is marked as deleted and
removed from view but remains in the system. Links to controls and risks are preserved.

**Restore** (minimum role `admin`): Deleted templates can be restored in the Admin
panel under "Trash".

**Permanent delete** (minimum role `admin`): Removes the template irreversibly
including version history and attachments. Cannot be undone.

---

## Review Due Dates

The **"Next review"** field is actively monitored:

- Templates whose review is due in ≤ 14 days appear in the **calendar** (highlighted red)
- The admin receives an **email notification** (if SMTP is configured)
- Due reviews appear as tasks on the **dashboard**

Recommendation: review policies annually, procedures every six months.
